1,48,ऋतंभरा तत्र प्रज्ञा,The wisdom that arises from this comprehension is infallible.,How does the mind behave once passed the higher levels of meditation? What special quality is bestowed once the mind succesfully achieves the higher levels of meditation? Can one fall even after reaching nirvichara state?,"Based on Bhagavad Gita Chapter 1, Verse 48, which states ""The wisdom that arises from this comprehension is infallible."", here is a concise and precise answer to your question:

Once the mind successfully achieves the higher levels of meditation (nirvichara state), it becomes steadfast and unshakeable, free from doubts and fluctuations. This state is characterized by the bestowal of special quality of ""infallible wisdom"" (anasrita-buddhi), which is a direct result of the comprehension (sambodha) described in the verse.

As for your second question, yes, one can fall even after reaching the nirvichara state. The Gita emphasizes the importance of continuous practice and vigilance to maintain this state, as the mind is prone to falling back into its default state of restlessness and distraction if one becomes complacent or neglects their spiritual practice.

""The impressions/ideas generated by this special knowledge, hinder the activation of other impressions.""

This verse suggests that after attaining the special knowledge (jnana), the impressions or ideas generated by it can hinder the activation of other impressions. This implies that even after reaching the nirvichara state (a state of higher awareness and understanding), other impressions or ideas may still arise, but they would be influenced and limited by the previous knowledge and understanding gained.

Therefore, the answer to the question is: Yes, other impressions can arise even after reaching the nirvichara state.

4,15,वस्तुसाम्ये चित्तभेदात्तयोर्विभक्तः पन्थाः,"Because there is a multiplicity of minds (perceiving an object) but yet the object remains consistent, there is a difference in nature between the object and the mind (of the observer).",Is the mind made up of the same elements as physical objects? What is the difference between the mind and physical body? What is the difference between the mind and physical objects?,"Based on Chapter 4, Verse 15 of the Bhagavad Gita, the answer is:

According to the verse, the mind and physical objects differ in nature. While physical objects remain consistent, the mind is multiplicitous, perceiving an object in various ways. Therefore, the mind is not made up of the same elements as physical objects. The difference between the mind and physical body lies in their respective natures: the physical body is consistent, whereas the mind is multiple and perceiving. The difference between the mind and physical objects lies in the mind's ability to perceive and interpret physical objects in various ways, whereas physical objects remain constant.

This verse suggests that the existence of an object is not solely dependent on a particular mind perceiving it. In other words, the moon, for example, continues to exist even when no one is watching.
