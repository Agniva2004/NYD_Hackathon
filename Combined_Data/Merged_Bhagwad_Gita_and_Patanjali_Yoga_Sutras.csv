The answer to your question is: No, a Jiva (soul) cannot be killed by anyone. The Lord is saying that the eternal, indestructible, unborn, and inexhaustible nature of the soul makes it impossible to be slain. The soul is beyond the reach of any physical or material harm.

In this verse, Lord Krishna is explaining the concept of reincarnation, where the embodied Self (the soul or Atman) casts off its worn-out physical body (the old clothes) and enters a new one. This process is repeated until the Self achieves liberation from the cycle of birth and death.

What is the atma?,"Based on Bhagavad Gita Chapter 2, Verse 25, spoken by भगवान (Lord Krishna), the answer to the question is:

According to verse 25, grieving is not suitable for those who know the Self or soul or atman. The Self (Atman) is described as:

* Unmanifested (अनिर्देश्य)
* Unthinkable (अनुपलभ्य)
* Unchangeable (अपरिवर्तनीय)

These characteristics imply that the Self is beyond human comprehension and is not subject to the fluctuations of the material world.

This suggests that grieving is not suitable even for those who do not believe in an eternal soul or Atman, as it is still unnecessary and counterproductive.

Can you explain the cycle of birth and death?,"Based on Bhagavad Gita Chapter 2, Verse 27, spoken by भगवान (Lord), the translation states: ""For the born, death is certain, and for the dead, birth is certain; therefore, you should not grieve over the inevitable.""

This verse emphasizes that death is an inevitable part of life, and birth is an inevitable part of death. This cycle of birth and death is known as ""samsara"" in Hinduism. According to this verse, it is unnecessary to grieve over death because it is a natural and inevitable process.

This teaching is not limited to those who believe in an eternal soul or self. It is applicable to all living beings, regardless of their beliefs or worldview. The verse does not rely on the concept of an eternal soul or self, but instead focuses on the universal truth of the cycle of birth and death.

In other words, the verse is saying that death is a natural part of life, and it is not something to be grieved over. It is an inevitable process that is common to all living beings, and it is not unique to any individual. Therefore, it is pointless to grieve over something that is inevitable and universal.

What is the secret of Karma?,"Based on Bhagavad Gita Chapter 2, Verse 47, the crux of Karma Yoga is that one's duty is to perform work (Karma) without being attached to its consequences or results. Here's a concise breakdown:

* Karma refers to the actions or duties that one performs in life.
* Karma Yoga is the path of selfless action, where one focuses on performing their duties without being motivated by the desire for rewards or the fear of consequences.
* To work according to Karma Yoga, one should perform their duties without attachment to the results, and without being driven by a desire for inaction (i.e., not doing anything).

The secret of work in Karma Yoga lies in performing one's duties with detachment and equanimity, without being influenced by personal desires or fears. The secret of Karma is that one's actions are not the source of their happiness or suffering, but rather the attitude and intentions behind those actions.

""When one thinks of objects, attachment to them arises; from attachment, desire is born; from desire, anger arises.""

Here's a concise answer to your question:

* When we think about sense objects (e.g., sights, sounds, smells), attachment to them arises.
* This attachment gives rise to desire, which further leads to anger.
* Attachment is wrong because it creates a sense of separation and ownership, obscuring our true nature.
* Detachment is necessary for spiritual progress because it allows us to see things as they truly are, rather than being clouded by personal desires and attachments.
* Working with attachment (i.e., performing actions while being attached to the results) can lead to bondage and suffering, as it fuels desires and anger, rather than leading to liberation and inner peace.

From this verse, it can be inferred that people who are satisfied with the Self (i.e., the Atman) do not need to perform worldly duties. The verse suggests that such individuals have transcended the need for external actions, as they are content with their inner state of being.

The answer to the question is:

Detachment is important because it allows one to perform actions without being bound by their consequences or outcomes. Detachment is the key to achieving spiritual growth and liberation (Moksha).

The result of detachment is that one reaches the Supreme, indicating spiritual realization and union with the ultimate reality.

""It is better to perform one's own duty, though devoid of merit, than the duty of another well discharged. Better is death in one's own duty; the duty of another is fraught with fear.""

This verse emphasizes the importance of performing one's own duty. It suggests that:

* Performing one's own duty, even if it lacks excellence, is better than doing someone else's duty well.
* Death (or failure) in one's own duty is preferable to success in someone else's duty, as the latter is fraught with fear and potential consequences.

To become successful and achieve success, one can:

* Focus on performing one's own duty to the best of one's abilities.
* Accept the outcome of one's actions, whether successful or not, with equanimity.
* Cultivate a sense of detachment and inner strength to face any challenges or consequences that may arise.

In essence, the key to success lies in embracing one's own duty and performing it with dedication, while being prepared to face the outcomes with courage and resilience.

What is the cause of ignorance? Is there any relation between desires and ignorance?,"Based on Bhagavad Gita Chapter 3, Verse 38, spoken by भगवान (God), the verse states: ""As fire is enveloped by smoke, as a mirror is covered by dust, and as an embryo is surrounded by the amniotic sac, so is this enveloped by that.""

In this context, ""this"" refers to the individual self (jiva) and ""that"" refers to the material body (prarabdha karma). The verse describes the relationship between the individual self and the material body, stating that the self is enveloped or covered by the body, just as a fire is enveloped by smoke, a mirror is covered by dust, and an embryo is surrounded by the amniotic sac.

Regarding the question, desire is not explicitly mentioned, but the verse implies that desire can be a cause of ignorance. The material body, which is covered by the individual self, is the source of desires. The desires and attachments to the material body create ignorance, as they obscure the individual's true nature and connection to the divine. The relationship between desires and ignorance is that desires drive the individual to identify with the material body and its desires, leading to ignorance of their true nature and spiritual goals.

In this verse, it is explicitly stated that desires are insatiable, likened to fire. This suggests that desires cannot be fully gratified, as they are inherently unquenchable. The verse implies that desires are a constant enemy of wisdom, implying that they can obscure one's understanding and distract from the pursuit of knowledge and spiritual growth.

4,6,भगवान,अजोऽपि सन्नव्ययात्मा भूतानामीश्वरोऽपि सन्| प्रकृतिं स्वामधिष्ठाय संभवाम्यात्ममायया || 4.6 ||  ,"Though I am unborn and of imperishable nature, and though I am the Lord of all beings, yet, governing my own nature, I am born by my own Maya.",What is the concept of Avatar or reincarnation? Can God take birth in a human form? Is it possible for God to be born on this earth?,"Based on Bhagavad Gita Chapter 4, Verse 6, the speaker भगवान (Lord) states: ""Though I am unborn and of imperishable nature, and though I am the Lord of all beings, yet, governing my own nature, I am born by my own Maya.""

This verse suggests that God (भगवान) can take birth in a human form, but with a twist. The Lord's own nature is unborn and imperishable, yet He can still be born through His own Maya (divine power). This concept is related to the idea of Avatar, which is the descent of the divine into the human realm. In this context, God's birth is not a literal or physical birth, but rather a manifestation of His power and energy.

So, to answer the question: yes, it is possible for God to be born on this earth, but not in the classical sense. Instead, God can manifest Himself in a human form as an Avatar, which is a unique and extraordinary event.

4,7,भगवान,यदा यदा हि धर्मस्य ग्लानिर्भवति भारत| अभ्युत्थानमधर्मस्य तदाऽऽत्मानं सृजाम्यहम् || 4.7 ||  ,"Whenever there is a decline of righteousness and an increase of unrighteousness, O Arjuna, then I manifest Myself.",When and why does God incarnate? Will Sanatana Dharma be eradicated some day? Can Hinduism be eradicated?,"Based on Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 4, Verse 7, Speaker: भगवान (Bhagavan, God):

The verse states: ""Whenever there is a decline of righteousness and an increase of unrighteousness, O Arjuna, then I manifest Myself.""

This verse indicates that God incarnates whenever there is a decline of righteousness (dharma) and an increase of unrighteousness in the world. This implies that God manifests Himself to restore balance and promote righteousness.

Regarding the question of whether Sanatana Dharma (Hinduism) can be eradicated, the verse does not explicitly address this. However, it can be inferred that as long as there is a decline of righteousness and an increase of unrighteousness, God will continue to manifest Himself to promote the values and principles of Sanatana Dharma.

In other words, as long as there is a need for guidance and restoration of righteousness, God will continue to incarnate and uphold the principles of Hinduism.

A Yogi who has renounced all fruits of his actions attains eternal peace.

A detached Yogi is one who has already achieved this state of being ""united"" and has abandoned the fruit of action, hence, he is already in a state of eternal peace.

A person who is unable to give up attachment is bound, as stated in the verse, and is not in a state of eternal peace.

The verse states that ""renunciation"" is what is meant by Yoga, implying that it involves giving up one's thoughts and desires. This is in contrast to the path of knowledge, which involves gaining insight and understanding through scriptural study and contemplation.

Can I meditate while sitting on my bed?,"Based on Bhagavad Gita Chapter 6, Verse 11, the speaker Bhagavan (Lord Krishna) describes the ideal seat for meditation as follows:

""In a clean spot, having established a firm seat of his own, neither too high nor too low, made of cloth, skin, and kusha grass layered one over the other.""

According to this verse, an ideal seat for meditation is one that is:

* Firm (not too high or too low)
* Made of cloth, skin, and kusha grass (a natural and simple arrangement)
* Clean

In terms of your question, here are some insights:

* Sitting on the floor: This can be a suitable option, as long as the floor is clean and the seat is firm.
* Sitting on a chair: This may not be the ideal option, as chairs can be too high or too low, and may not provide the necessary support for maintaining a steady posture.
* Sitting on the bed: This is not recommended, as beds are designed for sleeping and may not provide the necessary support or stability for meditation.

In general, it is recommended to sit on a simple, firm, and clean surface, such as a cushion or a meditation bench, to facilitate a comfortable and focused meditation practice.

The verse does not provide a specific recommendation for the duration of sleep. Instead, it cautions that excessive sleep or wakefulness is undesirable for achieving Yoga. Moderation is essential in all aspects of life, including eating, sleeping, and working. The importance of moderation is highlighted to maintain a balance and achieve spiritual growth.

Regarding fasting, the verse does not specifically discuss it. However, the principle of moderation can be applied to fasting as well. While occasional fasting may have its benefits, fasting for an extended period may not be recommended, as it may lead to physical and mental exhaustion, making it difficult to maintain the balance necessary for spiritual growth.

""Yoga becomes the destroyer of pain for him who is moderate in eating and recreation (such as walking, etc.), who exercises moderation in action, and who is moderate in sleep and wakefulness.""

In this verse,भगवान suggests that moderation is key to achieving yoga (inner balance and harmony). This implies that:

* Being a workaholic (exercising excessive action) is not good, as it would lead to imbalance.
* Overeating (exercising excessive eating and recreation) is indeed a bad idea, as it would also lead to imbalance and pain.

Chapter 6, Verse 19, Speaker: भगवान (God), Translation: As a lamp placed in a windless spot does not flicker, so is the Yogi of a controlled mind, who practices Yoga in the Self, compared.

The analogy for the mind of a yogi is a lamp placed in a windless spot, which does not flicker.

The analogy is found in:

Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 6, Verse 19:

""As a lamp placed in a windless spot does not flicker, so is the Yogi of a controlled mind, who practices Yoga in the Self, compared.""

The attributes of a meditative mind (yogi's mind) described in this verse are:

""Having obtained it, he thinks there is no other gain superior to it; established in it, he is not moved even by heavy sorrow.""

This verse suggests that a yogi (one established in yoga) has overcome the attachment to worldly gains and desires. Although they may still have desires, their focus is on the higher gain of spiritual growth and self-realization.

To handle sorrow, the verse implies that one should establish themselves in their spiritual practice (yoga) and cultivate a sense of detachment from external circumstances. This allows them to remain stable and unaffected by heavy sorrow.

To handle grief, it is crucial to acknowledge and accept the emotional pain, rather than suppressing it. A yogi would then focus on cultivating inner peace, compassion, and self-awareness to transcend the grief and find inner strength.

""Non-attachment, non-identification of the Self with son, wife, home, and the rest, and constant even-mindedness in the face of the attainment of both desirable and undesirable.""

This suggests that attachment to family members can indeed be a hindrance to spiritual growth, as it can lead to identification with the ego and the material world, rather than with the true Self.

What is the caste system in Hinduism? Is caste decided by birth or by personal preference? Is varna decided by birth or by personal preference?,"Based on Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 18, Verse 41, spoken by भगवान (God) to Arjuna, the answer is:

The varna system in Hinduism refers to the division of society into four categories: Brahmanas (priests and scholars), Kshatriyas (warriors and rulers), Vaisyas (merchants and traders), and Sudras (labourers and servants).

The caste system in Hinduism is a social hierarchy based on the varna system, where each individual is born into a particular varna and is expected to follow the traditional occupation and way of life associated with that varna.

According to this verse, varna is decided by birth, not by personal preference. The duties and occupations of each varna are determined by the qualities and natural tendencies of each individual, which are born of their own nature.

In contrast, the concept of caste is more complex and has evolved over time, with social and cultural factors influencing an individual's place in the social hierarchy.

From this verse, it can be inferred that it was not possible for Arjuna to give up fighting in the war. The verse suggests that Arjuna's resolve to not fight would be futile, as nature (or the circumstances) would compel him to fight anyway. This implies that the course of action was already predetermined and that Arjuna's free will was limited.

This verse suggests that our actions are influenced by our own nature (Karma) and are often performed despite our intentions or desires to the contrary. This implies that our free will is limited, and destiny (our pre-determined path) plays a significant role in shaping our decisions and actions.

In this context, it can be inferred that while we may have a sense of free will, it is not entirely efficacious, and our choices are often influenced by factors beyond our control. Therefore, the answer to the question is that destiny is more powerful than free will, as our actions are often predetermined by our Karma and are not entirely under our control.

How does praying to God help?,"According to Chapter 1, Verse 23, the other singular path to achieve the highest level of meditative absorption is being directed towards the ideal of pure awareness, which is referred to as Ishvara or God.

In the context of Yoga, the concept of God or Ishvara is not necessarily a literal deity, but rather a higher state of consciousness or the ultimate reality. Yogis do believe in this higher state, which is considered the ultimate goal of their practice.

Praying to God or Ishvara is not a primary focus of Yoga, but rather a means to cultivate devotion and surrender. The practice of praying to God helps in Yoga by:

* Fostering devotion and attachment to the ultimate reality, which can lead to a deeper sense of connection and understanding.
* Encouraging surrender, which allows the individual to let go of ego and attachment, making it possible to experience the ultimate reality.
* Serving as a meditation tool, helping to focus the mind and quiet the distractions.

In essence, praying to God or Ishvara in Yoga is a means to an end, rather than an end in itself. The ultimate goal is to transcend the individual self and experience the ultimate reality, not to worship a deity.

The verse states: ""तदर्थ एव दृश्यस्यात्मा"" (The purpose of the phenomenal world is essentially to reveal this truth for the seer).

This interdependence suggests that the Drasta (the seer or the self) cannot exist without the Drishya (the phenomenal world), and vice versa. The Drishya is not created for the benefit of the Drasta, but rather the Drishya is created to reveal the truth to the Drasta.

As for the question of why God created the world, the Yoga Sutras do not provide a direct answer. The text does not attribute the creation of the world to a deity or God. Instead, it focuses on the relationship between the seer and the phenomenal world, suggesting that the purpose of the world is to reveal truth to the seer. The creation of the world is not seen as a separate entity or an act of a deity, but rather as a manifestation of the ultimate reality (Brahman) that is being revealed to the seer.

What happens in the state of liberation? What is state of liberation with respect to Drasta and Drishya? How can Purusha be disassociated with Prakriti?,"Based on Patanjali Yoga Sutras, Chapter 2, Verse 25, the answer is:

Kaivalya is the state of liberation, where pure awareness (Purusha) is free and unaffected by the phenomenal world (Prakriti). In this state, the appearance of indivisibility (samyoga) between Purusha and Prakriti fades away, and it becomes clear that Purusha is distinct from Prakriti.

With respect to Drasta (the seer) and Drishya (the seen), in the state of liberation, the Drasta (Purusha) remains untouched and unaffected by the Drishya (Prakriti). The Purusha is no longer bound by the limitations of Prakriti, and its true nature as the pure awareness is revealed.

Purusha can be disassociated with Prakriti when the ignorance (avidya) that binds them together fades away. This disassociation allows the Purusha to shine in its true nature, unaffected by the changing circumstances of Prakriti.

To achieve Kailvalya or Liberation, one needs to cultivate unflinching discriminative discernment. This discernment is required to distinguish between the seer (the Self) and the seen (the world).

These powers are acquired by cultivating detachment and thorough knowledge of the mind's behavior, enabling the practitioner to transcend the limitations of the physical body and mind.

However, the possibility of perfectly knowing the behavior of the mind is not explicitly stated in this verse. In the Yoga Sutras, it is acknowledged that the mind is constantly changing and is influenced by various factors, making it challenging to fully understand and control. Nevertheless, the practice of Yoga and detachment can help the practitioner develop a deeper understanding of the mind and its behavior.

This means that our perception of the sequence of conscious events is filtered through our individual consciousness, shaping our experiences and understanding of reality.

Does the universe have a beginning? Do our mental impressions have a beginning? Do our mental impressions get created at birth? When does our mind start accumulating impressions? When does our mind start to learn? Is a child born with a blank state?,"According to Patanjali Yoga Sutras, Chapter 4, Verse 10, it is stated that ""These (subconscious impressions) are beginningless as the desire (to exist) is everlasting."" This verse suggests that samskaras (mental impressions) do not have a beginning, implying that they are eternal and have been present since the beginning of existence. This is further reinforced by the idea that the desire to exist is everlasting, implying that the existence of the universe and its component parts, including the mind, is also eternal. Therefore, it can be concluded that:

* The samskaras do not have a beginning.
* The universe does not have a beginning.
* The mental impressions (samskaras) are eternal and pre-exist the individual's birth.
* The mind starts accumulating impressions before birth, as the samskaras are beginningless.
* The mind starts to learn and accumulate impressions from a state that precedes birth, rather than starting from a blank slate at birth.
* A child is not born with a blank state, but rather inherits the accumulated samskaras from previous lives, which influence their thoughts, emotions, and behaviors.

4,15,Rishi Patanjali,वस्तुसाम्ये चित्तभेदात्तयोर्विभक्तः पन्थाः,"Because there is a multiplicity of minds (perceiving an object) but yet the object remains consistent, there is a difference in nature between the object and the mind (of the observer).",Is the mind made up of the same elements as physical objects? What is the difference between the mind and physical body? What is the difference between the mind and physical objects?,"Based on Chapter 4, Verse 15 of the Patanjali Yoga Sutras, the answer to your question is:

No, the mind is not made up of the same elements as physical objects. The verse states ""वस्तुसाम्ये चित्तभेदात्तयोर्विभक्तः पन्थाः"" which translates to ""Because there is a multiplicity of minds (perceiving an object) but yet the object remains consistent, there is a difference in nature between the object and the mind (of the observer)"". This suggests that the mind and physical objects have different natures or characteristics.

The difference between the mind and physical body lies in the fact that the mind is capable of perceiving and experiencing multiple aspects of reality, whereas the physical body is limited to its own physical properties. The mind is also capable of abstraction, intuition, and introspection, which are not characteristic of physical objects.

The difference between the mind and physical objects is that the mind is aware and perceiving, whereas physical objects are not. The mind is the perceiver, whereas physical objects are the perceived. This fundamental difference in nature is highlighted in this verse, emphasizing the distinct characteristics of the mind and physical objects.

Does the moon exist when no one is watching? Do objects exist when no one is watching?,"According to Chapter 4, Verse 16 of the Patanjali Yoga Sutras, the answer is ""no"". The verse states that an object is not dependent on a single mind for its existence, suggesting that the existence of an object is not tied to the perception of that object by a specific mind. This implies that the moon, for example, exists independently of whether anyone is watching it.

What is the role of attention in perception?,"According to Patanjali Yoga Sutras, Chapter 4, Verse 17, an object becomes known by the mind (jñāta) when it is noticed by the mind (cittaḥ). This implies that attention plays a crucial role in perception, as the mind must focus on the object to become aware of it. In other words, attention is necessary for the mind to ""notice"" an object, thereby making it known to the mind.

Does the soul know the mind? Does Purusha know the mind?,"According to Patanjali Yoga Sutras, Chapter 4, Verse 18, the answer is:

Yes, the soul (Purusha) knows the permutations of the mind. The verse states: ""sadājñātāścittavṛttayaḥ"" which translates to ""the permutations of the mind are always known"" to the Purusha. This implies that the Purusha, being the master of the mind, is aware of the mind's changes and fluctuations.

Can one mind be experienced by another mind?,"According to Patanjali Yoga Sutras, Chapter 4, Verse 21, the answer is: No, one mind cannot be cognized by another mind. The verse states ""चित्तान्तरदृश्ये... स्मृतिसंकरश्च"" (cittāntardṛṣye... smṛtisaṅkaraśca), which translates to ""If (the mind) were cognized by another mind, then there would be an infinite regress of one intelligence (being known) by another intelligence."" This suggests that the mind cannot be directly perceived or cognized by another mind, lest it lead to an infinite regress, causing confusion of memory.
