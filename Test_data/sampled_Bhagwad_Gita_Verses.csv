6,22,भगवान,यं लब्ध्वा चापरं लाभं मन्यते नाधिकं ततः| यस्मिन्स्थितो न दुःखेन गुरुणापि विचाल्यते || 6.22 || ,"Having obtained it, he thinks there is no other gain superior to it; established in it, he is not moved even by heavy sorrow.",do Yogis also have desires? How can we handle sorrow? How can we handle grief?,"According to Bhagavad Gita Chapter 6, Verse 22, the speaker Lord Krishna says:

""Having obtained it, he thinks there is no other gain superior to it; established in it, he is not moved even by heavy sorrow.""

This verse suggests that a yogi (one established in yoga) has overcome the attachment to worldly gains and desires. Although they may still have desires, their focus is on the higher gain of spiritual growth and self-realization.

To handle sorrow, the verse implies that one should establish themselves in their spiritual practice (yoga) and cultivate a sense of detachment from external circumstances. This allows them to remain stable and unaffected by heavy sorrow.

To handle grief, it is crucial to acknowledge and accept the emotional pain, rather than suppressing it. A yogi would then focus on cultivating inner peace, compassion, and self-awareness to transcend the grief and find inner strength.

Yes, each person has faith in something, as their nature dictates (भगवान, 17.3). People's faith is a reflection of their inherent nature (people consist of their faith; as a person's faith is, so are they). This means that individuals are naturally inclined towards certain beliefs, values, or ideologies, which shape their worldview and faith.
