They had also drank water for the last time and eaten grass terminally.  (Giving   away   useless   articles   as   gift   in   a   sacrifice is   a   sin   and   cannot   bring   good   reward.)"

सस्यमिव मर्त्यः पच्यते सस्यमिवाजायते पुनः ॥","Remember   how   your   forefathers   behaved .   Consider   how   men   of   worth conduct   themselves   today.   Like   vegetation   man   ripens   and decays,   and   like   vegetation  he   is   born   again ."

He will recognise   you and   treat   you   as   in the past,   having   seen you  released   from   the   jaws   of   death.  And he will be without   anger .

2.3,14,"यदा सर्वे प्रमुच्यन्ते कामा येऽस्य हृदि श्रिताः ।
अथ मर्त्योऽमृतो भवत्यत्र ब्रह्म समश्नुते ॥","The mortal gains  immortality  and  in  this  life  becomes  Brahman, when   all   the   yearnings  in  his  mind  are   dissolved."
2.3,15,"यदा सर्वे प्रभिद्यन्ते हृदयस्येह ग्रन्थयः ।
अथ मर्त्योऽमृतो भवत्येतावद्ध्यनुशासनम् ॥","In this body,  when all  those  knots  in  the  mind  are  cut  ,  then the  mortal  becomes  immortal ;  thus runs the  instruction (in Vedic scriptures)."
2.3,16,"शतं चैका च हृदयस्य नाड्य-
    स्तासां मूर्धानमभिनिःसृतैका ।
तयोर्ध्वमायन्नमृतत्वमेति
    विष्वङ्ङन्या उत्क्रमणे भवन्ति ॥ ","Of the  hundred   and   one   are    nerves   of   the   heart;   one   extends towards  the   top (crown) of   the   head. Proceeding upwards through it, man attains deathlessness and the  others   lead  one  to   different   destinations (human or non-human form)."
2.3,17,"अङ्गुष्ठमात्रः पुरुषोऽन्तरात्मा
    सदा जनानां हृदये संनिविष्टः ।
तं स्वाच्छरीरात्प्रवृहेन्मुञ्जादिवेषीकां धैर्येण ।
तं विद्याच्छुक्रममृतं तं विद्याच्छुक्रममृतमिति ॥","In  the  heart  of   everybeing  dwells,   the  inner soul,  of  the  dimension   of   the  human  thumb  ,  The Purusha,  whom through meditation  and persverance is like  drawing  out a thread from  the stalk.  Him one should know as pure  and  immortal. Him one should know as pure  and  immortal."
2.3,18,"मृत्युप्रोक्तां नचिकेतोऽथ लब्ध्वा
    विद्यामेतां योगविधिं च कृत्स्नम् ।
ब्रह्मप्राप्तो विरजोऽभूद्विमृत्यु-
    रन्योऽप्येवं यो विदध्यात्ममेव ॥","Instructed  by  Yama ,  in  the  knowledge, in this manner, as also  in the  technique  of  Yoga  Sastra,  Nachiketa  became  sinless  and transcended physical  death  and attained Brahman.  Also  any other  will do  so ,  on  realising the Brahman."
